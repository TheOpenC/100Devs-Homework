// algorithms -- steps you take to solve a problem. 
//  some steps are more efficiently than others. 
// Brute force first > then refine for space and time. 
// space - how much memory is being consumed. 
// time - Big O notation. Operations per input. 
//  how much do we have to do for each operation? that's time. 

// thinking through appropriate algorithms is how we can efficiently solve problems

// Companies care about space & time  == less $$ for efficient code. 

// we care about rough estimates -- not precision 

// Complexities:
// O(1) example
